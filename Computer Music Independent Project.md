### Description

This independent study explores creative expression through computer technology. Students will research technology platforms, present their findings in regular meetings, and use what they learn to create original works of music. Technology platforms relevant to the course include [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max), [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/), [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/), [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/); students may choose to focus on one or more of these platforms, or incorporate others with guidance from the professor.

### Meetings

Students will meet weekly with the professor and one another and present _each_ the following:

- a new technique they discover for using a technology platform for their creative works
- an implementation of the technique in their current project
- an example of a related technique used in an existing project, through recordings, video, or other documentation on the web

### Project

Students will work independently or collaboratively with one another one or more new pieces of music, sound installations, or other artworks. The work _must_ include sound and must be controlled or executed using technologies researched during the course. The work will be publicly presented near the end of the semester, on or before Friday, 8 December. Depending on the nature of the project, this could be a performance, class presentation, or public exhibition/installation.

### Grading

The course will be evaluated pass-fail, based on the completion and presentation of the final project.
